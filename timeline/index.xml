<h2 id="week-1">Week 1</h2>

<p>
I am still not 100% certain what I would like to pursue for the final project,
so I am going to list several ideas that I am considering. I hope to
chat with someone on the course staff to consult on the feasibility of each idea
before making a final decision.
</p>

<h3> Idea 1: Farming Robot </h3>

<p>
This was something I mentioned in the application for this class, but I think it
might be beyond the realm of possibility. I am envisioning a four-wheel drive rover
that would be capable of planting seeds, removing weeds, monitoring progress of crops,
and harvesting the crops. I grew up on a farm, so I know a little bit about how traditional
seed planters work. Most of them have some sort of "seed plate," which allows them to evenly
space out the plants. Here is a photo of what I'm talking about:
</p>

<p>
So, I at least have an idea of how the planting aspect would work. In regard to removing weeds, the
first hurdle would be identifying them in the first place. Either that, or the robot would have to
remember exactly where each seed was originally placed and cultivate the rest of the surrounding area. However, I think
it would be more ideal to use some kind of computer vision to locate and "terminate" any weeds in the garden. The monitoring aspect would also require computer vision, as it would need to identify fruit on the plants. I'm thinking maybe it would take photos of any potential fruits and send them to the user to be verified. Finally, I have no idea how I would go about harvesting the crops. It would be highly dependent on which type of plant I wanted to optimize the robot for, so I will try to think of crops that are "easier" to harvest.
</p>

<h3> Idea 2: Calendar DrawBot</h3>

<p>
My second idea is to create a drawing robot that could draw a calendar on a blank sheet of paper and fill in each day with "handwritten" reminders. Ideally, I would create a companion app or webpage that controlled the "DrawBot," which would result in the user being able to sync their digital calendar with their physical calendar. My initial thought was to  create a robot that hooked up with a keyboard and allowed the user to type "handwritten" messages. However, a quick Google search showed that "DrawBots" are relatively common:
</p>

<p>
Although a keyboard-powered "DrawBot" would be pretty cool too, I think a Calendar DrawBot would be a little more challenging and useful. I'm thinking of a bunch of neat features, such as having it cross out individual tasks once the user marks them as complete or crossing out the days on the calendar once they are over. I was also thinking of having a grid of small LEDs behind the drawing surface, and the device could turn on the LED behind each corresponding day to signal what day it was. I think there are a lot of possibilities with this one!

<h3> Idea 3: Cookie Making Robot </h3>

<p>
My third idea is to build a machine capable of measuring out and mixing together the ingredients to make cookies. It would have a bunch of different compartments for each of the ingredients (eg. flour, salt, chocolate chips, etc...) and some system of weighing and dispensing everything. I think the best way to do it would be to have a scale on a track beneath all the different compartments so it could travel to each individual one to weigh out the ingredients. The compartments would need a small hatch that opened when the scale moved beneath it. Then, the scale would dump the ingredient into a general mixing bowl and engage a mixer of some sort. I could probably modify an old mixer from a thrift store, as I suspect it would be hard to fabricate my own food-grade machine that was powerful enough. The following image is nothing like what I've described here, but it's the best thing that came up when I searched for "cookie making robot":

<p><h3> Idea 4: Smart Pen Holder </h3>
<p>
 My fourth idea is to create a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; pen holder that could retrieve specific pens on voice command. I&rsquo;m thinking of something  like one of those old 6 disk CD changers that we used to have in our cars. It would be a lazy susan type system that would ask you to provide a name for each pen you put in it. Then you could say something like &ldquo;Hey PenBot, get me my yellow highlighter,&rdquo; and it would rotate the turnstile to the correct slot. Computer vision could also be incorporated into this one, so it could remember what certain pens look like and it wouldn&rsquo;t ask you to name the pen again when you put it back in. For anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know what a lazy susan is:
